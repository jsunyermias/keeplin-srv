# Keeplin agent guide

This file is the provider-neutral, canonical contract for every human or automated agent
working in either Keeplin repository. Read it completely before changing code or
documentation. Provider-specific files such as `CLAUDE.md` may add tool setup, but must not
repeat or override this contract.

## What Keeplin is and where work belongs

Keeplin is a pre-release, self-hostable notes system written in Rust. The repositories split
responsibility as follows:

- `jsunyermias/keeplin`
  - `keeplin-core`: domain models, storage backends, sync, collaboration client, shared wire
    and format contracts.
  - `keeplin-daemon`: gRPC and REST surfaces, configuration, authentication, metrics and
    local process lifecycle.
- `jsunyermias/keeplin-srv`
  - `crates/keeplin-srv`: the Axum/PostgreSQL multi-user server, collaborative WebSocket
    sessions, sync relay, accounts, devices and sharing.

Put shared types and constants in `keeplin-core`; the server consumes them from a pinned
revision. A change that crosses the repository boundary is one logical change and needs
coordinated PRs and contract tests.

## Commands

Run commands from the root of the repository being changed.

```bash
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
./scripts/check-docs.sh
```

For `keeplin`, the focused suites are `cargo test -p keeplin-core` and
`cargo test -p keeplin-daemon`. For `keeplin-srv`, `cargo test --workspace` must run
against PostgreSQL and includes the `sqlx::test` integration tests described in its README.
CI builds the knowledge graph with the pinned version and publishes `graphify-out/` as a
workflow artifact. To reproduce that build and its validation locally, run:

```bash
pip install graphifyy==0.9.25
GRAPHIFY_REQUIRED=1 ./scripts/check-graph.sh
```

The generated `graphify-out/` directory is ignored and must never be staged or committed. The
old auto-refresh pre-commit hook was removed because CI, rather than a commit, now owns the
artifact. If this clone previously enabled that repository hook, remove its local setting with:

```bash
git config --unset core.hooksPath
```

Never report a check as passing unless it ran successfully. Record unavailable checks and
their reason in the PR.

## graphify

CI generates a knowledge graph with god nodes, community structure and cross-file
relationships and publishes it as the `knowledge-graph-<commit SHA>` artifact. A local
`graphify update .` creates the same ignored `graphify-out/` layout for optional navigation.

Rules:
- For codebase questions, first run `graphify query "<question>"` when a generated or downloaded `graphify-out/graph.json` exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and `graphify explain "<concept>"` for focused concepts. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep output.
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
- Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
- Never require a local Graphify install or graph to understand the repository: deliver the
  target companion directly when the artifact is unavailable.
- `.graphifyignore` is the corpus contract. It excludes generated/build/vendor trees and all
  Markdown through `*.md`, then explicitly retains only `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `SECURITY.md` and
  `docs/adr/*.md`. Companions, templates, repository guidance, prompts and operational documents
  therefore remain outside LAYER 1 and must be read directly when relevant.
- Companions are graph outputs only in the documentation sense: code relationships may refresh
  their `## Graph context`, but companion prose and embedded fences never feed back into the
  graph. The direction is code -> graph -> companion, never companion -> graph.
- `scripts/check-graph.sh` generates twice, validates corpus exclusions and report quality, and
  fails when the same tree produces different deterministic graph structure. CI then publishes
  the ignored output; contributors do not commit it.

## Companion .md format

Companion .md format: docs/templates/source-module.md (v2.5.0, mechanically verified).
Read it fully before touching any companion .md. Its 9 HARD RULES are
contractual and scripts/check-docs.sh enforces them mechanically.

The nine rules, summarized without replacing the template, are:

1. Every leaf block is embedded complete and verbatim, including its `// md:` marker,
   attributes and full body.
2. Code fences never elide content. Split an oversized source block instead of shortening
   its companion fence.
3. A signature in Identification never substitutes for the complete Code fence.
4. Source block, `// md:` marker, companion section and coverage row have a strict 1:1:1:1
   correspondence.
5. A block implements one function, type, feature or inseparable small helper group and
   follows source order.
6. Containers document members as sub-blocks and do not duplicate their code; only a
   container's declaration, attributes and braces are scaffolding, so anything else in its
   preamble — imports included — needs its own marker and leaf section.
7. Fidelity is mechanical: `scripts/sync-companion-code --check` maps every leaf fence to
   source exactly (LF/CRLF normalization only), rejects unmarked code in a container
   preamble, and runs inside the repository-wide docs check.
8. Dependencies name the exact symbols used and the behavioral contract each use expects.
9. Rust source contains no comments except `// md:` markers; explanation belongs in the
   companion.

Use `scripts/context-pack <source-or-symbol> --list --profile understand|edit|review|cross-repo`
to estimate bounded, reproducible companion inputs. Regenerate the provenance-labelled index
with `scripts/context-pack manifest` after companion metadata changes.

## Documentation & Knowledge Consistency Policy

Documentation is part of the implementation, not a post-development task. A task is not
complete until the codebase, knowledge graph and documentation consistently describe the
same state of the project.

### Mandatory completion checks

Before marking any task as complete, perform the following verification steps:

1. Update every companion document corresponding to any modified source file so it
   accurately reflects the current implementation.
2. When changes affect architecture or relationships, refresh affected companion Graph context
   from a local or downloaded graph when needed. Never commit `graphify-out/`; CI generates and
   validates the graph for the exact commit.
3. Update every affected project document (for example: `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `README.md`,
   `SECURITY.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, ADRs or any other relevant documentation).
4. Verify that:
   - code and companions are consistent;
   - Graphify corpus configuration and the CI artifact represent the current codebase;
   - documentation matches the implementation;
   - internal references and cross-references remain valid.
5. If any inconsistency is detected, resolve it before completing the task.

### Completion rule

Never consider a task finished while any known discrepancy exists between:

- source code;
- companion documentation;
- Graphify corpus configuration and CI artifact;
- project documentation.

The repository must always remain in a self-consistent state after every completed task.

## Cross-repo compatibility (keeplin ↔ keeplin-srv)

`keeplin` (client/daemon) and `keeplin-srv` (server) share a wire/format contract: the
collab protocol (`keeplin-core::collab::protocol`), `PROTOCOL_VERSION`
(`keeplin-core::compat`), the `Change` model, the format limits, and the encryption
envelope. Any change that touches a shared surface must keep both sides intercompatible —
it is not complete until that is guaranteed.

- `keeplin-core` is the single source of truth for shared wire/format types and constants;
  `keeplin-srv` imports them rather than redefining them.
- `keeplin-srv` pins `keeplin-core` to a concrete immutable reference (an exact `tag`/`rev`,
  never a branch or "latest") so the server can never silently drift from the client.
- A breaking change to a shared surface bumps `PROTOCOL_VERSION` on both sides in lockstep.
- A change to a shared surface is not complete until a cross-repo compatibility test covers
  it: a round-trip of every protocol message and shared constant against `keeplin-core`'s
  real types.

## Persistence and wire invariants

These repository-specific rules are mandatory and are preserved verbatim from the previous
pull request templates.

### `keeplin`

- Proto changes (if any) are **additive** — new field numbers only, existing numbers never renumbered or reused.
- On-disk / on-wire format changes bump the relevant version (`FsBackend::FORMAT_VERSION`, `DbBackend::SCHEMA_VERSION`) with a migration step, and the change is documented in the companion.

### `keeplin-srv`

- New migrations are **forward-only** and idempotent (`ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`, `CREATE … IF NOT EXISTS`); existing migrations are never edited after being applied.
- New `NOT NULL` columns carry a `DEFAULT` so existing rows stay valid without a table rewrite.
- Every migration `.sql` has its companion `.md`.
- Any `SELECT` feeding a `sqlx::FromRow` struct includes all of that struct's columns (a missing column fails the row decode at runtime, not at compile time).

## Workflow and review independence

1. Start from an issue with observable acceptance criteria, prepared with
   `docs/prompts/0.A-prompt-comun.md` on `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/implementation.md`.
2. Create a dedicated branch; never work directly on `main`.
3. Open a draft PR and keep its scope limited to the issue.
4. Run the applicable checks and record evidence without conflating author claims with CI.
5. Have a different model family or a human independently review the objective and diff.
6. Resolve findings and conversations, obtain green required checks on the exact commit,
   then mark the PR ready for the maintainer to merge.

### Convergence is mechanical

Step 6 above ends on a computed condition, never on an agent's satisfaction.
[keeplin ADR 0008](https://github.com/jsunyermias/keeplin/blob/main/docs/adr/0008-trusted-evaluator-verified-disposal-and-a-bounded-history-claim.md)
is the standing decision, superseding 0004 through 0006; `.github/scripts/check-review-loop.js`
enforces it on every non-draft pull request. The ADRs themselves live in `keeplin`, so they are
linked there rather than by a path this repository does not carry.

A default-branch `workflow_run` evaluator is authoritative, and disposal
requires independently authored, machine-readable authorization plus commit/workflow/App-bound
success evidence when resolved. Fork pull requests deliberately fail closed.

- A finding **blocks** only if it is *reified*: expressed as something that fails
  mechanically — a test, a property, a contract assertion, or a `scripts/check-docs.sh`
  check. A finding that cannot be reduced to a failing check is **advisory**: recorded in the
  ledger, not blocking. Advisory is not a verdict on importance; it is a statement about what
  can be checked, and a real defect filed advisory still earns a follow-up issue.
- **A pull request has converged when its required checks are green and no reified finding is
  open.** "The reviewer is satisfied" is not a convergence condition and is not accepted as
  one anywhere in the pipeline. Green means positive evidence: a check that has not finished
  is not a green check, which is why the `Review loop converged` job runs only after every
  required job has completed.
- Every finding is recorded in the pull request's **review ledger** with a stable ID and one
  state: `open`, `resolved`, `dismissed` or `advisory`. A `dismissed` finding cites its reason
  — a priority decision or an accepted ADR — and re-raising it does not reopen it and does not
  start a round unless the code in its area changed.
- A finding that names a mechanical check is reified and cannot simultaneously have `advisory`
  state. Changing a previously reified finding to advisory needs verified authorization, and
  reification is remembered across every surviving journal record — retiring an ID with an
  authorized tombstone does not let it return unreified. The protection is still bounded.
  Terminal truncation is not detected: it can erase the record that established reification,
  after which the shorter authentic prefix may converge with that finding advisory.
- The blocking set `{red required checks} ∪ {open reified findings}` must shrink strictly each
  round.
- The brake is state, not a clock. When the loop-state hash repeats, or the blocking set has
  not shrunk for three rounds, the loop **escalates to the maintainer** naming the exact
  finding or check that is stuck, and the stall is recorded in
  [`docs/review-stalls.md`](docs/review-stalls.md) the way review debt is recorded. Continuing
  to iterate after a stall without that record is prohibited.
- The App-authored digest chain detects editing of every record. It detects deletion only when
  a surviving descendant commits to the deleted record. An actor with repository write access
  can truncate the newest record and the evaluator will read the shorter prefix as though those
  rounds never happened; terminal truncation is not detected.

This is a floor beneath independent review, never a substitute for it. A converged pull request
with no independent reviewer is still unmergeable, and convergence never ticks the review boxes
of `.github/pull_request_template.md`. The ledger is part of the diff the independent reviewer
examines. That conjunction is **required** by this policy and intended to be enforced by branch
protection, which is configured outside this repository and which no script here verifies. It is
**not** upheld by
the evaluator: `check-review-governance.js` runs inside the head-controlled `ci.yml`, so a head
can weaken the step while the job still reports success, and the evaluator has no evidence the
gate ran.
[keeplin ADR 0009](https://github.com/jsunyermias/keeplin/blob/main/docs/adr/0009-governance-evaluated-from-the-default-branch.md)
accepts moving governance into the default-branch evaluator; implementation is pending in a
dedicated pull request.

Start shared analysis with `docs/prompts/0.A-prompt-comun.md`. The default role split is
advisory: Claude documents and prepares issues, Kimi implements with
`docs/prompts/0.B-prompt-implementacion-issue.md`, and Codex reviews with
`docs/prompts/0.C-prompt-revision-seguridad.md`. The hard rule is that the implementer is
not the only reviewer. Independent review starts from the issue objective and the diff,
not from the author's defense as its sole source.

### Independent review is not an agent's to waive

The hard rule binds every agent without exception. An agent does not waive independent
review, does not treat its own re-reading of the diff as satisfying it, and does not tick the
review boxes of `.github/pull_request_template.md` on that basis. Merging is the maintainer's
act; an agent that performs one on the maintainer's instruction has executed a decision, not
supplied the missing review.

Only the maintainer sets the requirement aside, explicitly and for one named pull request.
Silence, ambiguity, a green CI run, a deadline and a bare "merge it" are not waivers to
infer — and an instruction that would merge an unreviewed change is acted on only after
saying so plainly.

Before acting on a waiver, say once, in a sentence or two, what goes unchecked: which diff,
which family implemented it, and the class of defect an independent reviewer would have gone
looking for. Name that risk concretely rather than restating the rule. Then comply without
repeating the objection — the decision belongs to the maintainer and has been made.

A waived change merges as **review debt**, not as a reviewed change. In the same session it
merges, record it in [`docs/review-debt.md`](docs/review-debt.md), naming the follow-up issue
or the sweep that will carry the deferred review, so it is scheduled like any other work
instead of remembered informally. The entry clears only when an independent reviewer has
actually examined the merged change. Until then the change is merged, not done.

## ADR requirements

Security, persistence, migration, synchronization, protocol and other high-risk
architectural changes require an accepted ADR before implementation. This also applies to
authentication, permissions, privacy, retention, new operational dependencies, and removal
or weakening of an existing protection. The local registry and the link to the canonical
cross-repository template live in [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/README.md).

An ADR records the decision, alternatives, invariants, compatibility and migration impact,
failure modes, verification, and rollback or recovery plan. `proposed` does not authorize
implementation: only the maintainer moves a decision to `accepted` or `rejected`. Once
accepted, its decision body is historical record; replace it with a new superseding ADR
instead of rewriting it to match later code. If an issue depends on an undecided ADR, stop at
the decision boundary rather than embedding an unreviewed architecture choice in code.

Cross-repository decisions are canonical in `keeplin/docs/adr/`; server-only decisions live
in this repository's `docs/adr/`. Both records and both PRs link each other instead of
duplicating a decision.

## Definition of done

A change is done only when its issue criteria are met; its review loop has converged
mechanically — required checks green and no reified finding open, with any open entry in
`docs/review-stalls.md` counting as an open condition here; applicable code, companions, graph
and project docs agree; focused and repository checks pass or explicit blockers are
recorded; cross-repo surfaces and tests are coordinated; and an independent reviewer has
examined the objective and diff. A maintainer waiver defers that examination and never
removes it: an open entry in `docs/review-debt.md` is an open condition here.

Do not call a change or deployment production-ready based only on happy-path tests. Claims
must cover failure behavior, security boundaries, persistence and recovery, compatibility,
operations and rollback evidence appropriate to the change.

## Protected `main`

Both repositories require changes through PRs, required status checks on the exact merge
candidate, resolved conversations, and protection against force-pushes and deletion. The
maintainer performs merges. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the contributor flow and repository
settings that enforce it.
