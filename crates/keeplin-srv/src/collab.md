# `collab.rs` — the collaborative session engine

Self-contained companion for `crates/keeplin-srv/src/collab.rs`. It documents **every code block of
the source file, in source order, with its complete code embedded** — a reader with only this file must be able to
understand `collab.rs` without opening anything else, so project-wide conventions are
deliberately re-explained here (hyper-redundancy is intended).

**How to navigate**: every block in `collab.rs` carries exactly one marker comment of the
form `// md:<Header> > … > <Block header>`, whose path is the header chain of the section
documenting it here (starting below the file title). Grep the marker text to jump
code → doc; grep the section's block name (or the marker path) in the `.rs` to jump
doc → code. Each block section covers five fixed points: **Identification**,
**What it does**, **Dependencies**, **Used by**, **Repeated context**.

## Overview

**Identification** — file-level block: the module's imports. Marker `// md:Overview` at
the top of the file.

**Code** — complete and verbatim:

```rust
// md:Overview
use std::collections::HashMap;
use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicU64, Ordering};
use std::sync::Arc;
use std::time::Duration;

use axum::{
    extract::{
        ws::{Message, WebSocket, WebSocketUpgrade},
        Query, State,
    },
    http::HeaderMap,
    response::Response,
};
use chrono::{DateTime, Utc};
use futures_util::{SinkExt, StreamExt};
use keeplin_core::format::{
    CODE_LINE_TOO_LONG, CODE_TOO_MANY_LINES, MAX_LINES_PER_NOTE, MAX_LINE_BYTES,
};
use keeplin_core::storage::note_log::{resolve, VersionVector, Winner};
use tokio::sync::{mpsc, Mutex, RwLock};
use uuid::Uuid;

use crate::{
    auth,
    error::AppError,
    permissions::resolve_note_access,
    protocol::{
        CollabClientMsg, CollabServerMsg, Cursor, LineOp, LineSnapshot, NoteLinesSnapshot,
        PresenceInfo,
    },
    state::AppState,
    store::Line,
};
```

**What it does** — The collaborative-editing engine behind `GET /api/ws` (design §7):
per-note live sessions, presence, and the application of `LineOp`s against the
versioned line + order entities. The server is the **broker and durable source of
truth** (design §2.4): it validates each operation, resolves it against current state
with keeplin-core's `note_log::resolve`, persists it, and fans the applied ops out to
the note's other subscribers with a monotonically increasing `server_seq`. Clients are
stateful: they keep their own copy and rebuild from the `Welcome` snapshot on
(re)connect — **there is no infinite op log**.

Conflict rules (design §5): per **line**, `resolve(local, incoming)` — the op is
applied iff the incoming write wins (causally newer by version vector, or concurrent
and winning the deterministic `(timestamp, writer)` tiebreak); a dominated op is
silently ignored. Per **order** (`Insert`/`Move`), the same resolution against the
note's order entity; an applied op merges its vector into the order's. **No locks
anywhere for conflict resolution** — the in-process and advisory locks below serialise
*application*, never decide *winners*.

**Dependencies** — external: `axum` (WS upgrade, extractors), `tokio` (`mpsc`,
`Mutex`, `RwLock`, atomics, time), `futures_util` (socket split),
`keeplin_core::storage::note_log::{resolve, VersionVector, Winner}` (client repo, the
shared resolution function), `serde_json`, `chrono`, `uuid`, `tracing`. Internal:
`auth::verify_token` (`auth.rs`), `AppError` (`error.rs`), `resolve_note_access`
(`permissions.rs`), the wire types (`protocol.rs`), `AppState` (`state.rs`), and the
line/order/presence/outbox methods of `store.rs`.

**Used by** — `http.rs` routes `GET /api/ws` to `handler`; `state.rs` holds the
`CollabRegistry`; `bus.rs` calls `deliver_event` / `deliver_presence`;
`http.rs::metrics` reads `CollabRegistry::stats`. Exercised by `tests/collab.rs`
(raw-JSON protocol tests), the three `collab_client_*_e2e` tests (real keeplin-core
client), and `tests/soak.rs` (multi-instance drill).

**Repeated context** — The device-as-actor rule: ops are signed with the JWT's
**device id** (`last_writer` + vv components); presence is **user**-scoped. Snapshot
rebuild is the universal recovery path (lag, drop, reconnect, missed bus event). All
durable state is PostgreSQL rows (lines, `note_line_order`, presence table,
`collab_events` outbox); everything in this module's memory is per-instance and
rebuildable — which is what makes the multi-replica model (issue #45) sound.

---

## Constants

**Identification** — logical section: the six tuning constants; marker
`// md:Constants`.

**Code** — complete and verbatim:

```rust
// md:Constants
const MAX_WS_MESSAGE: usize = 1024 * 1024;

const OUTBOUND_CAPACITY: usize = 256;
const PING_INTERVAL: Duration = Duration::from_secs(30);
const ACTIVITY_TIMEOUT: Duration = Duration::from_secs(90);
```

**What it does** — The one limit this file still owns: `MAX_WS_MESSAGE`, the largest
incoming WebSocket frame (1 MiB). The **format** limits — max bytes per line and max
lines per note — are no longer declared here: since issue keeplin#130 they live in
`keeplin_core::format` (`MAX_LINE_BYTES` = 2¹² = 4096 bytes, `MAX_LINES_PER_NOTE` =
2¹⁶ = 65 536 lines) and this crate imports them, so the server cannot drift from the
client that enforces the same numbers before it ever sends an op. They replace the
former local `MAX_LINE_LEN = 10_000` / `MAX_LINES_PER_NOTE = 100_000`. Plus the
connection hygiene knobs:
`OUTBOUND_CAPACITY` — bounded outbound queue per connection; a slow/stalled consumer
is **dropped** rather than buffering without limit (issue #34), safe because a
stateful client rebuilds from the next `Welcome` snapshot. `PING_INTERVAL` — periodic
pings keep NAT/proxy paths open and surface a dead peer via a failed write
(issue #35). `ACTIVITY_TIMEOUT` — if no frame at all (not even a pong) arrives within
this window, the peer is treated as dead and the connection closed (issue #35).

**Dependencies** — none.

**Used by** — `handler` (`MAX_WS_MESSAGE`), `run_connection` (the three connection
knobs); the imported format limits are used by `apply_op`.

**Repeated context** — Limits are enforced **before persisting** (in `apply_op`), so
the database can never hold an over-limit line/order. 4096 × 65 536 bounds a note's
theoretical materialised body at ~256 MiB (down from ~1 GB under the old limits),
which is why the REST read path still has its own `MAX_NOTE_BODY_BYTES` cap
(issue #44, `config.rs`).

---

## Subscriber

**Identification** — private struct; marker `// md:Subscriber`.

**Code** — complete and verbatim:

```rust
// md:Subscriber
struct Subscriber {
    tx: mpsc::Sender<String>,
}
```

**What it does** — One live connection's entry in a session: the sending half of its
bounded outbound channel. Everything else about the connection (user, device, joined
notes) lives on the connection task's stack; presence lives in the shared table.

**Dependencies** — `tokio::mpsc`.

**Used by** — `CollabSession.subscribers`; inserted by `handle_msg` (`Join`), removed
on `Leave`/disconnect/slow-consumer drop.

**Repeated context** — Frames are pre-serialised `String`s so one serialisation
serves every subscriber (see `broadcast`).

---

## CollabSession

**Identification** — public struct; marker `// md:CollabSession`.

**Code** — complete and verbatim:

```rust
// md:CollabSession
pub struct CollabSession {
    seq: AtomicU64,
    apply_lock: Mutex<()>,
    subscribers: RwLock<HashMap<u64, Subscriber>>,
}
```

**What it does** — One live collaborative session per note with at least one
subscriber (design §3.5), created on demand and destroyed when the last subscriber
leaves. Fields: `seq` — the monotonic per-session sequence stamped on each fanned-out
`Op` by *this* instance (a connection only ever talks to one instance, so a
per-instance counter is enough for the client's gap detection — issue #45);
`apply_lock` — serialises op application and join snapshots for this note, so a
joiner can never miss an op between reading the snapshot and subscribing, and two op
batches never interleave their read-modify-write; `subscribers` — the live
connections keyed by `conn_id`. If the server restarts, clients reconnect and get a
fresh snapshot from the database — the session holds **no durable state**.

**Dependencies** — `Subscriber` (this file), tokio sync primitives.

**Used by** — `CollabRegistry.sessions`; `handle_msg`, `deliver_event`,
`deliver_presence`, `run_connection` (this file).

**Repeated context** — The apply lock is in-process only; cross-instance
serialisation of order writes is the Postgres advisory lock
(`store::lock_note_order`) taken inside the `Op` path. Winners are still decided by
version-vector resolution — the locks only serialise application.

---

## CollabRegistry

**Identification** — public struct; marker `// md:CollabRegistry`.

**Code** — complete and verbatim:

```rust
// md:CollabRegistry
#[derive(Default)]
pub struct CollabRegistry {
    sessions: RwLock<HashMap<Uuid, Arc<CollabSession>>>,
    next_conn_id: AtomicU64,
}
```

**What it does** — All live sessions on this instance, keyed by note id, plus the
connection-id allocator (`next_conn_id`, unique per instance). Lives in `AppState`
(`::default()` at boot — empty).

**Dependencies** — `CollabSession` (this file).

**Used by** — `state.rs::AppState.collab`; `bus.rs` (via `get`),
`http.rs::metrics` (via `stats`), this file's connection handling.

**Repeated context** — Per-instance, rebuildable memory; the shared truth for
"who is present" is the presence *table*, not this map.

---

## impl CollabRegistry

**Identification** — inherent impl block; marker `// md:impl CollabRegistry`.
Contains `stats`, `get`, `get_or_create`, `drop_if_empty` (next sections).

**Code** — container: members documented as sub-blocks below: fn stats, fn get, fn get_or_create, fn drop_if_empty.

**What it does** — Session lookup/lifecycle: metrics, bus lookup, on-demand
creation, lazy destruction.

**Dependencies / Used by / Repeated context** — see the method subsections.

### fn stats

**Identification** — public async method; marker
`// md:impl CollabRegistry > fn stats`.
`pub async fn stats(&self) -> (usize, usize)`.

**Code** — complete and verbatim:

```rust
    // md:impl CollabRegistry > fn stats
    pub async fn stats(&self) -> (usize, usize) {
        let sessions = self.sessions.read().await;
        let mut connections = 0;
        for session in sessions.values() {
            connections += session.subscribers.read().await.len();
        }
        (sessions.len(), connections)
    }
```

**What it does** — `(live note sessions, live subscriber connections)` for
`GET /api/metrics`.

**Dependencies** — none. **Used by** — `http.rs::metrics`.

**Repeated context** — none.

### fn get

**Identification** — public async method; marker
`// md:impl CollabRegistry > fn get`.
`pub async fn get(&self, note_id: Uuid) -> Option<Arc<CollabSession>>`.

**Code** — complete and verbatim:

```rust
    // md:impl CollabRegistry > fn get
    pub async fn get(&self, note_id: Uuid) -> Option<Arc<CollabSession>> {
        self.sessions.read().await.get(&note_id).cloned()
    }
```

**What it does** — The live session for a note on *this* instance, if any. The bus
entrypoints use it to deliver a sibling's op/presence to local subscribers
(issue #45); no session → nothing to deliver → no-op.

**Dependencies** — none. **Used by** — `deliver_event`, `deliver_presence` (this
file).

**Repeated context** — none.

### fn get_or_create

**Identification** — private async method; marker
`// md:impl CollabRegistry > fn get_or_create`.
`async fn get_or_create(&self, note_id: Uuid) -> Arc<CollabSession>`.

**Code** — complete and verbatim:

```rust
    // md:impl CollabRegistry > fn get_or_create
    async fn get_or_create(&self, note_id: Uuid) -> Arc<CollabSession> {
        let mut sessions = self.sessions.write().await;
        sessions
            .entry(note_id)
            .or_insert_with(|| {
                Arc::new(CollabSession {
                    seq: AtomicU64::new(0),
                    apply_lock: Mutex::new(()),
                    subscribers: RwLock::new(HashMap::new()),
                })
            })
            .clone()
    }
```

**What it does** — The session for a note, created (fresh `seq = 0`, empty
subscribers) if absent, under the map's write lock.

**Dependencies** — `CollabSession` (this file). **Used by** — `handle_msg`
(`Join`).

**Repeated context** — `seq` restarting at 0 for a fresh session is fine: clients
use `server_seq` only for gap detection within one connection's stream.

### fn drop_if_empty

**Identification** — private async method; marker
`// md:impl CollabRegistry > fn drop_if_empty`.
`async fn drop_if_empty(&self, note_id: Uuid)`.

**Code** — complete and verbatim:

```rust
    // md:impl CollabRegistry > fn drop_if_empty
    async fn drop_if_empty(&self, note_id: Uuid) {
        let mut sessions = self.sessions.write().await;
        if let Some(session) = sessions.get(&note_id) {
            if session.subscribers.read().await.is_empty() {
                sessions.remove(&note_id);
            }
        }
    }
```

**What it does** — Removes the note's session if it has no subscribers left. Called
after `Leave` and on disconnect — lazy cleanup keeps the map bounded by live notes.

**Dependencies** — none. **Used by** — `handle_msg` (`Leave`), `run_connection`
(teardown).

**Repeated context** — none.

---

## impl CollabSession

**Identification** — inherent impl block; marker `// md:impl CollabSession`.
Contains `broadcast` (next section).

**Code** — container: members documented as sub-blocks below: fn broadcast.

**What it does / Dependencies / Used by / Repeated context** — see `fn broadcast`.

### fn broadcast

**Identification** — private async method; marker
`// md:impl CollabSession > fn broadcast`.

**Code** — complete and verbatim:

```rust
    // md:impl CollabSession > fn broadcast
    async fn broadcast(&self, msg: &CollabServerMsg, skip_conn: Option<u64>) {
        let text = serde_json::to_string(msg).expect("serializable server msg");
        let mut slow = Vec::new();
        {
            let subscribers = self.subscribers.read().await;
            for (conn_id, sub) in subscribers.iter() {
                if Some(*conn_id) == skip_conn {
                    continue;
                }
                if sub.tx.try_send(text.clone()).is_err() {
                    slow.push(*conn_id);
                }
            }
        }
        if !slow.is_empty() {
            let mut subscribers = self.subscribers.write().await;
            for conn_id in slow {
                subscribers.remove(&conn_id);
            }
        }
    }
```

**What it does** — Sends `msg` to every subscriber, optionally skipping one
connection (the originator of an op already has it applied locally). Serialises the
message **once**, then `try_send`s to each subscriber's bounded queue. A subscriber
whose queue is full (slow/stalled consumer) is collected and **removed from the
session** after the read pass (issue #34) — it reconnects and rebuilds from a fresh
snapshot rather than buffering without bound.

**Dependencies** — `Subscriber`, `CollabServerMsg` (`protocol.rs`), `serde_json`.

**Used by** — `deliver_presence`, `deliver_event`, `handle_msg` (`Op` fan-out).

**Repeated context** — Dropping a slow consumer is safe *because* of the
snapshot-rebuild model: no collab message is load-bearing for durability — the rows
are.

---

## fn touch_presence

**Identification** — private async function; marker `// md:fn touch_presence`.

**Code** — complete and verbatim:

```rust
// md:fn touch_presence
async fn touch_presence(
    state: &AppState,
    note_id: Uuid,
    conn_id: u64,
    user_id: Uuid,
    display_name: &str,
    cursor: Option<&Cursor>,
) -> Result<(), AppError> {
    let cursor_json = cursor.map(|c| serde_json::to_value(c).unwrap_or(serde_json::Value::Null));
    state
        .store
        .upsert_presence(
            note_id,
            state.instance_id,
            conn_id as i64,
            user_id,
            display_name,
            cursor_json.as_ref(),
        )
        .await?;
    announce_presence(state, note_id).await;
    Ok(())
}
```

**What it does** — Records (upserts) this connection's presence row — keyed
`(note_id, instance_id, conn_id)`, carrying user id, display name and the optional
caret as opaque JSON — in the shared presence table, then `announce_presence` so
every replica rebroadcasts the merged list (issue #45).

**Dependencies** — `Store::upsert_presence` (`store.rs`), `announce_presence`
(this file), `Cursor` (`protocol.rs`).

**Used by** — `handle_msg` (`Join` with no cursor, `Cursor` with one).

**Repeated context** — Presence is ephemeral and unversioned: rows are
heartbeat-touched by the maintenance loop (`main.rs`) for this instance and swept by
TTL when an instance crashes; receivers always get the **full** list and replace.

---

## fn clear_presence

**Identification** — private async function; marker `// md:fn clear_presence`.
`async fn clear_presence(state, note_id, conn_id) -> Result<(), AppError>`.

**Code** — complete and verbatim:

```rust
// md:fn clear_presence
async fn clear_presence(state: &AppState, note_id: Uuid, conn_id: u64) -> Result<(), AppError> {
    state
        .store
        .delete_presence(note_id, state.instance_id, conn_id as i64)
        .await?;
    announce_presence(state, note_id).await;
    Ok(())
}
```

**What it does** — Deletes this connection's presence row and announces the new
merged list.

**Dependencies** — `Store::delete_presence` (`store.rs`), `announce_presence`
(this file).

**Used by** — `handle_msg` (`Leave`), `run_connection` (disconnect teardown).

**Repeated context** — Rows a crashed instance leaves behind are reclaimed by the
TTL sweep (`main.rs` maintenance loop) and by each instance clearing its own rows at
startup — this function is only the orderly path.

---

## fn announce_presence

**Identification** — private async function; marker `// md:fn announce_presence`.
`async fn announce_presence(state: &AppState, note_id: Uuid)`.

**Code** — complete and verbatim:

```rust
// md:fn announce_presence
async fn announce_presence(state: &AppState, note_id: Uuid) {
    deliver_presence(state, note_id).await;
    let payload = format!("{}:{}", note_id, state.instance_id);
    if let Err(e) = state.store.notify("collab_presence", &payload).await {
        tracing::warn!(error = %e, %note_id, "presence notify failed");
    }
}
```

**What it does** — Broadcasts the merged presence to **this** instance's
subscribers now (`deliver_presence`), then notifies the other instances
(`collab_presence` channel, payload `"<note_id>:<instance_id>"`) to do the same.
The local broadcast means presence works single-instance even with no bus running;
the instance id in the payload lets a sibling's bus handler skip the echo back to
us. A notify failure is logged, not propagated.

**Dependencies** — `deliver_presence` (this file), `Store::notify` (`store.rs`),
`bus.rs` channel semantics.

**Used by** — `touch_presence`, `clear_presence` (this file).

**Repeated context** — Origin-delivers-locally is the bus's core convention
(`bus.rs`): the origin instance never depends on its own notification coming back.

---

## fn deliver_presence

**Identification** — public async function; marker `// md:fn deliver_presence`.
`pub async fn deliver_presence(state: &AppState, note_id: Uuid)`.

**Code** — complete and verbatim:

```rust
// md:fn deliver_presence
pub async fn deliver_presence(state: &AppState, note_id: Uuid) {
    let Some(session) = state.collab.get(note_id).await else {
        return;
    };
    let rows = match state.store.list_presence(note_id).await {
        Ok(rows) => rows,
        Err(e) => {
            tracing::warn!(error = %e, %note_id, "presence read failed");
            return;
        }
    };
    let mut by_user: HashMap<Uuid, PresenceInfo> = HashMap::new();
    for row in rows {
        let cursor = row
            .cursor
            .and_then(|c| serde_json::from_value::<Cursor>(c).ok());
        by_user
            .entry(row.user_id)
            .and_modify(|p| {
                if p.cursor.is_none() {
                    p.cursor = cursor.clone();
                }
            })
            .or_insert_with(|| PresenceInfo {
                user_id: row.user_id.to_string(),
                display_name: row.display_name,
                cursor,
            });
    }
    session
        .broadcast(
            &CollabServerMsg::Presence {
                note_id,
                users: by_user.into_values().collect(),
            },
            None,
        )
        .await;
}
```

**What it does** — Bus entrypoint (also used locally): if this instance has a live
session for the note, read all presence rows (every instance's) from the shared
table, merge them **per user** — a user connected twice appears once; the first
non-`None` cursor wins — and broadcast the full `CollabServerMsg::Presence` list to
local subscribers. No session or a read failure → warn/return.

**Dependencies** — `CollabRegistry::get`, `CollabSession::broadcast` (this file);
`Store::list_presence` (`store.rs`); `PresenceInfo`/`Cursor` (`protocol.rs`).

**Used by** — `announce_presence` (local path) and `bus.rs::handle_collab_presence`
(cross-instance path).

**Repeated context** — Presence lists are **replace, never merge** on the client;
user-scoped (the UI shows people, not devices).

---

## fn deliver_event

**Identification** — public async function; marker `// md:fn deliver_event`.
`pub async fn deliver_event(state: &AppState, event: crate::store::CollabEvent)`.

**Code** — complete and verbatim:

```rust
// md:fn deliver_event
pub async fn deliver_event(state: &AppState, event: crate::store::CollabEvent) {
    let Some(session) = state.collab.get(event.note_id).await else {
        return;
    };
    let ops: Vec<LineOp> = match serde_json::from_value(event.ops) {
        Ok(ops) => ops,
        Err(e) => {
            tracing::warn!(error = %e, note_id = %event.note_id, "collab event ops unparseable");
            return;
        }
    };
    let _guard = session.apply_lock.lock().await;
    let server_seq = session.seq.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed) + 1;
    session
        .broadcast(
            &CollabServerMsg::Op {
                server_seq,
                note_id: event.note_id,
                user_id: event.user_id.to_string(),
                ops,
            },
            None,
        )
        .await;
}
```

**What it does** — Bus entrypoint: a `collab_op` outbox event authored by
*another* instance (the caller — `bus.rs::handle_collab_op` — already filtered out
our own). If this instance has a live session for the note: parse the stored ops
JSON back into `Vec<LineOp>` (unparseable → warn/return), then **take the session's
apply lock** — serialising against a concurrent local join so a just-subscribed
connection cannot miss this op between its snapshot and subscribe (the op is
already durable; a duplicate delivery is resolved away by the client) — stamp this
instance's own next `server_seq`, and broadcast `CollabServerMsg::Op` to all local
subscribers.

**Dependencies** — `CollabRegistry::get`, `CollabSession::{apply_lock, seq,
broadcast}` (this file); `store::CollabEvent` (`store.rs`); `LineOp`
(`protocol.rs`).

**Used by** — `bus.rs::handle_collab_op` only.

**Repeated context** — Each instance stamps its **own** sequence on cross-instance
ops: `server_seq` is a per-connection-stream ordering aid, not a global order; the
global order is settled by vv resolution at the database.

## fn handler

**Identification** — public async function (axum handler); marker
`// md:fn handler`.

**Code** — complete and verbatim:

```rust
// md:fn handler
pub async fn handler(
    State(state): State<Arc<AppState>>,
    Query(params): Query<HashMap<String, String>>,
    headers: HeaderMap,
    ws: WebSocketUpgrade,
) -> Result<Response, AppError> {
    let header_token = headers
        .get("authorization")
        .and_then(|v| v.to_str().ok())
        .and_then(|h| h.strip_prefix("Bearer "));
    let token = header_token
        .or(params.get("token").map(String::as_str))
        .ok_or(AppError::MissingToken)?;
    let authed = auth::verify_token(token, &state.config.jwt_secret)?;
    match state.store.get_device(authed.device_id).await? {
        Some(device) if device.user_id == authed.user_id => {}
        _ => return Err(AppError::InvalidToken),
    }
    let user = state
        .store
        .get_user_by_id(authed.user_id)
        .await?
        .ok_or(AppError::InvalidToken)?;
    Ok(ws
        .max_message_size(MAX_WS_MESSAGE)
        .on_upgrade(move |socket| async move {
            run_connection(state, socket, user.id, authed.device_id, user.display_name).await;
        }))
}
```

**What it does** — `GET /api/ws` (design §7.1). Token resolution: prefer the
`Authorization: Bearer` header — a token in the query string ends up in
proxy/access logs — with `?token=` kept as a fallback for WS clients that cannot
set headers; absent → `MissingToken` (401). Verify the JWT; then the **revocation
check** (issue #20): the token's device must still exist and belong to the token's
user (`store.get_device`), exactly like REST's `auth_mw` and the sync relay's
handshake — otherwise a revoked token would keep editing notes until `exp`. Load
the user row (for the display name; a vanished user → `InvalidToken`). Upgrade with
`MAX_WS_MESSAGE` and run `run_connection`. The token authenticates the **user**;
which notes the connection may touch is checked per `Join`/`Op` against the shares.

**Dependencies** — `auth::verify_token` (`auth.rs`); `Store::{get_device,
get_user_by_id}` (`store.rs`); `MAX_WS_MESSAGE`, `run_connection` (this file).

**Used by** — `http.rs::router` (the `/api/ws` route).

**Repeated context** — The crate-wide revocation invariant: every authenticated
surface re-checks the device row (REST, `/api/sync`, here), which is what makes the
365-day default `TOKEN_TTL_DAYS` acceptable.

## fn run_connection

**Identification** — private async function; marker `// md:fn run_connection`.

**Code** — complete and verbatim:

```rust
// md:fn run_connection
async fn run_connection(
    state: Arc<AppState>,
    socket: WebSocket,
    user_id: Uuid,
    device_id: Uuid,
    display_name: String,
) {
    let conn_id = state.collab.next_conn_id.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed);
    let (mut sink, mut stream) = socket.split();

    let (tx, mut rx) = mpsc::channel::<String>(OUTBOUND_CAPACITY);
    let writer = tokio::spawn(async move {
        let mut ping = tokio::time::interval(PING_INTERVAL);
        ping.reset();
        loop {
            tokio::select! {
                msg = rx.recv() => match msg {
                    Some(text) => {
                        if sink.send(Message::Text(text)).await.is_err() {
                            break;
                        }
                    }
                    None => break,
                },
                _ = ping.tick() => {
                    if sink.send(Message::Ping(Vec::new())).await.is_err() {
                        break;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    });

    let mut joined: HashMap<Uuid, Arc<CollabSession>> = HashMap::new();

    loop {
        let msg = match tokio::time::timeout(ACTIVITY_TIMEOUT, stream.next()).await {
            Ok(Some(Ok(msg))) => msg,
            _ => break,
        };
        let text = match msg {
            Message::Text(text) => text,
            Message::Close(_) => break,
            _ => continue,
        };
        let client_msg: CollabClientMsg = match serde_json::from_str(&text) {
            Ok(m) => m,
            Err(e) => {
                send_error(&tx, "bad_message", &format!("unparseable message: {e}"));
                continue;
            }
        };
        if let Err(e) = handle_msg(
            &state,
            &tx,
            conn_id,
            user_id,
            device_id,
            &display_name,
            &mut joined,
            client_msg,
        )
        .await
        {
            tracing::warn!(error = %e, %user_id, "collab message failed");
            send_error(&tx, "internal", "internal error");
        }
    }

    for (note_id, session) in joined {
        session.subscribers.write().await.remove(&conn_id);
        let _ = clear_presence(&state, note_id, conn_id).await;
        state.collab.drop_if_empty(note_id).await;
    }
    writer.abort();
}
```

**What it does** — One collaborative connection. Setup: allocate a `conn_id`;
split the socket; spawn the **writer task** — all outbound traffic (welcomes,
fan-out, presence, errors) funnels through one bounded `mpsc` channel
(`OUTBOUND_CAPACITY`) so a single task owns the sink (issue #34), and that task
also emits periodic pings (`PING_INTERVAL`, first tick after the interval, not
immediately) whose failed write surfaces a dead peer (issue #35).

Read loop: wait for the next frame **bounded by `ACTIVITY_TIMEOUT`** — a peer gone
silent (not even answering pings) is dropped instead of leaking a subscriber slot
forever (issue #35); any frame, including a pong, counts as activity. Text frames
parse as `CollabClientMsg` (parse failure → `bad_message` error frame, connection
stays open) and dispatch to `handle_msg` (an internal error is logged and answered
with an `internal` error frame). `Close`/timeout/transport error → exit the loop.

The `joined` map holds the sessions this connection subscribed to. **Access is
deliberately not cached in it** (issue #30): it is re-resolved per operation so a
revoked share takes effect without waiting for a reconnect.

Teardown: for every joined note — remove the subscriber, clear the shared presence
row, drop the session if empty — then abort the writer task.

**Dependencies** — `CollabRegistry::next_conn_id`, `handle_msg`, `send_error`,
`clear_presence`, `drop_if_empty`, the connection constants (this file);
`futures_util` split; `tokio` mpsc/timeout.

**Used by** — `handler` (this file) only.

**Repeated context** — One-writer-per-socket is what makes the bounded-queue drop
policy sound (no interleaved partial writes); the timeout/ping pair is the leak
defence of issues #34/#35.

---

## fn send_error

**Identification** — private function; marker `// md:fn send_error`.
`fn send_error(tx: &mpsc::Sender<String>, code: &str, message: &str)`.

**Code** — complete and verbatim:

```rust
// md:fn send_error
fn send_error(tx: &mpsc::Sender<String>, code: &str, message: &str) {
    send_note_error(tx, None, code, message);
}
```

**What it does** — Sends a **connection-level** error: one that belongs to no
particular note (an unparseable frame, an internal failure). Delegates to
`send_note_error` with `note_id: None`, which is what the client reads as "nothing
to resynchronise".

**Dependencies** — `send_note_error` (this file); expects it to keep `None` meaning
"not attributable to a note", because the client only repairs a rejection it can
attribute.

**Used by** — `run_connection`, `handle_msg` (this file).

**Repeated context** — Error codes used across this file: `bad_message`,
`not_found`, `forbidden`, `not_joined`, `bad_writer`, `bad_content`, `too_long`,
`too_many_lines`, `line_exists`, `bad_after`, `bad_move`, `internal`. They are a
client-facing contract (tests assert them); the two format-limit codes come from
`keeplin_core::format` rather than being typed out here.

---

## fn send_note_error

**Identification** — private function; marker `// md:fn send_note_error`.
`fn send_note_error(tx: &mpsc::Sender<String>, note_id: Option<Uuid>, code: &str, message: &str)`.

**Code** — complete and verbatim:

```rust
// md:fn send_note_error
fn send_note_error(tx: &mpsc::Sender<String>, note_id: Option<Uuid>, code: &str, message: &str) {
    let msg = CollabServerMsg::Error {
        code: code.into(),
        message: message.into(),
        note_id,
    };
    let _ = tx.try_send(serde_json::to_string(&msg).expect("serializable error"));
}
```

**What it does** — Serialises a `CollabServerMsg::Error { code, message, note_id }`
and `try_send`s it to the connection's outbound queue. Best-effort: if the queue is
full the error is dropped (that connection is already being dropped as a slow
consumer). Errors are per-frame; the connection stays open.

`note_id` is the point of this function (issue keeplin#130). A rejection the client
cannot attribute to a note is a rejection the client cannot repair: it used to
`warn!` and move on, leaving the refused edit sitting on that device, apparently
saved and never syncing. With the note named, the client drops that note's mirror
and rejoins, so the server's snapshot replaces the divergent body. The field is
`skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none"`, so connection-level errors put nothing
extra on the wire and an older client — which does not know the field — parses both
shapes unchanged.

**Dependencies** — `CollabServerMsg` (`protocol.rs`) — expects its `Error` variant
to keep the optional `note_id` and keep it optional, since dropping the default
would break older clients; `serde_json`.

**Used by** — `send_error` (the `None` case) and `handle_msg`, which passes
`Some(note_id)` for every `OpOutcome::Invalid` — every op rejection is attributable
by construction, because ops only arrive inside an `Op { note_id, .. }` message.

**Repeated context** — the collaborative channel never closes on a rejected frame;
recovery is always "resynchronise this note", never "reconnect".

**What it does** — Dispatch on the client message:

- **`Join { note_id }`** — load the note (`not_found` if absent/invisible); resolve
  access and require `can_read` (`forbidden` otherwise — viewers may join and
  watch). Then, **under the session's apply lock**: read the snapshot, insert the
  subscriber, and enqueue the `Welcome` — all three together, so (a) no op can slip
  between snapshot and subscription (local ops and cross-instance ops both take
  this lock before broadcasting) and (b) the `Welcome` is queued on the
  connection's channel before any op can be, keeping `Welcome` first. The resolved
  access is intentionally **not stored** (issue #30) — writes re-resolve per op
  batch. Record the note in `joined` and `touch_presence` (shared table + notify,
  issue #45).
- **`Leave { note_id }`** — remove the subscriber, clear presence, drop the
  session if empty.
- **`Op { note_id, ops }`** — must have joined (`not_joined` otherwise).
  **Re-resolve access** on every batch (issue #30): note gone → `not_found`; access
  revoked → `forbidden`; `can_write` required (viewers get `forbidden`). Then apply
  sequentially under the session's in-process apply lock **and** a Postgres
  advisory lock keyed by the note (`store.lock_note_order` — a transaction holding
  `pg_advisory_xact_lock`), so two instances editing the same order serialise at
  the database and cannot lose an update (issue #45). Per op, `apply_op` on the
  lock's connection: `Applied` ops are collected, `Ignored` ops dropped silently,
  `Invalid` ops answered with an error frame **naming the note**
(`send_note_error(tx, Some(note_id), …)`), so a client whose op was refused over a
format limit can resynchronise that note instead of diverging. Commit (releases the advisory lock);
  if anything applied, stamp `server_seq` and broadcast to the note's other local
  subscribers (skipping the originator). Finally, cross-instance fan-out
  (issue #45): serialise the applied ops into the `collab_events` outbox and NOTIFY
  `collab_op` with `"<seq>:<instance_id>"` — done **after** the local broadcast so
  local latency is unaffected; siblings deliver under their own sequence; outbox
  failures are logged, not fatal (a missed sibling delivery heals by snapshot
  rebuild).
- **`Cursor { note_id, cursor }`** — if joined, `touch_presence` with the caret
  (which broadcasts the merged list).
- **`Ack { .. }`** — client-side bookkeeping; nothing to do server-side.

**Dependencies** — `resolve_note_access` (`permissions.rs`); `Store::{get_note,
lock_note_order, insert_collab_event, notify}` (`store.rs`); `read_snapshot`,
`apply_op`, `send_error`, `send_note_error`, `touch_presence`, `clear_presence`,
session/registry methods (this file); wire types (`protocol.rs`).

**Used by** — `run_connection` (this file) only.

**Repeated context** — The Join-under-lock choreography and the per-op access
re-resolution are the two auditor-visible fixes this file carries (join-gap
soundness; issue #30 revocation). The advisory lock closes the cross-instance
lost-update window on the order (issue #45; also the reason tombstone GC must
serialise against it — issue #25).

## fn read_snapshot

**Identification** — private async function; marker `// md:fn read_snapshot`.

**Code** — complete and verbatim:

```rust
// md:fn read_snapshot
async fn read_snapshot(state: &AppState, note_id: Uuid) -> Result<NoteLinesSnapshot, AppError> {
    let order = state
        .store
        .get_note_order(note_id)
        .await?
        .ok_or(AppError::NotFound)?;
    let lines = state.store.list_lines(note_id).await?;
    Ok(NoteLinesSnapshot {
        note_id,
        order: order.order,
        updated_at: order.updated_at,
        vv: order.vv,
        last_writer: order.last_writer,
        lines: lines.into_iter().map(line_snapshot).collect(),
    })
}
```

**What it does** — Builds the `Welcome` payload: the note's order entity
(`get_note_order` — `NotFound` if the note has no order row) plus every line
(`list_lines`, tombstones included), converted via `line_snapshot`.

**Dependencies** — `Store::{get_note_order, list_lines}` (`store.rs`);
`NoteLinesSnapshot` (`protocol.rs`); `line_snapshot` (this file).

**Used by** — `handle_msg` (`Join`) — under the apply lock.

**Repeated context** — Snapshots include tombstoned lines (soft-delete: deletion
is a `deleted_at` timestamp, never row removal) so a client that was offline
during a delete still converges on it.

---

## fn line_snapshot

**Identification** — private function; marker `// md:fn line_snapshot`.
`fn line_snapshot(line: Line) -> LineSnapshot`.

**Code** — complete and verbatim:

```rust
// md:fn line_snapshot
fn line_snapshot(line: Line) -> LineSnapshot {
    LineSnapshot {
        id: line.id,
        content: line.content,
        created_at: line.created_at,
        updated_at: line.updated_at,
        deleted_at: line.deleted_at,
        vv: line.vv.0,
        last_writer: line.last_writer,
    }
}
```

**What it does** — Converts the store's `Line` row into the wire shape
(`LineSnapshot`), unwrapping the stored vv (`line.vv.0` — the store wraps
`VersionVector` in a JSONB newtype).

**Dependencies** — `Line` (`store.rs`), `LineSnapshot` (`protocol.rs`).

**Used by** — `read_snapshot` (this file).

**Repeated context** — none.

---

## OpOutcome

**Identification** — private enum; marker `// md:OpOutcome`.

**Code** — complete and verbatim:

```rust
// md:OpOutcome
enum OpOutcome {
    Applied(LineOp),
    Ignored,
    Invalid { code: String, message: String },
}
```

**What it does** — The result of resolving one op. `Applied(op)`: the op won its
resolution and was persisted — fan it out. `Ignored`: dominated by current state
(design §4.3.3) — drop **silently** (this is normal convergence, not an error).
`Invalid { code, message }`: malformed or referencing missing entities — tell the
sender.

**Dependencies** — `LineOp` (`protocol.rs`).

**Used by** — `apply_op` (produces), `handle_msg` (consumes).

**Repeated context** — Silence on `Ignored` is deliberate: a replica replaying an
op it already sent, or losing a race it will learn about via fan-out, needs no
signal.

---

## fn invalid

**Identification** — private function; marker `// md:fn invalid`.
`fn invalid(code: &str, message: impl Into<String>) -> OpOutcome`.

**Code** — complete and verbatim:

```rust
// md:fn invalid
fn invalid(code: &str, message: impl Into<String>) -> OpOutcome {
    OpOutcome::Invalid {
        code: code.into(),
        message: message.into(),
    }
}
```

**What it does** — Constructor shorthand for `OpOutcome::Invalid`.

**Dependencies** — `OpOutcome` (this file). **Used by** — `apply_op`.

**Repeated context** — none.

---

## fn merge_vv

**Identification** — private function; marker `// md:fn merge_vv`.
`fn merge_vv(a: &VersionVector, b: &VersionVector) -> VersionVector`.

**Code** — complete and verbatim:

```rust
// md:fn merge_vv
fn merge_vv(a: &VersionVector, b: &VersionVector) -> VersionVector {
    let mut out = a.clone();
    for (k, v) in b {
        let entry = out.entry(k.clone()).or_insert(0);
        if *v > *entry {
            *entry = *v;
        }
    }
    out
}
```

**What it does** — The pointwise maximum of two version vectors — the merged
causal frontier stored on an entity after an op is applied. (A `VersionVector` is
a map from actor id — always a device id here — to a monotonically increasing
counter.)

**Dependencies** — `VersionVector` (keeplin-core).

**Used by** — `apply_op` (all four arms, when writing the winning state).

**Repeated context** — Storing the *merge* (not the op's vv verbatim) is what
makes the entity's vector dominate both histories afterwards — the foundation of
convergence.

---

## fn advances_writer

**Identification** — private function; marker `// md:fn advances_writer`.
`fn advances_writer(current: &VersionVector, op_vv: &VersionVector, writer: &str) -> bool`.

**Code** — complete and verbatim:

```rust
// md:fn advances_writer
fn advances_writer(current: &VersionVector, op_vv: &VersionVector, writer: &str) -> bool {
    op_vv.get(writer).copied().unwrap_or(0) > current.get(writer).copied().unwrap_or(0)
}
```

**What it does** — Design §4.3.5: an op's vector must advance its **own writer's**
component past the entity's current one. Replays of an already-applied op fail
this and are ignored — which is what keeps application **idempotent**.

**Dependencies** — `VersionVector` (keeplin-core).

**Used by** — `apply_op` (all four arms, before resolution).

**Repeated context** — Idempotency is a system-wide requirement (relay redelivery,
bus at-least-once, client retries all rely on it); this check is its collab-side
enforcement point.

---

## fn apply_op

**Identification** — private async function; marker `// md:fn apply_op`.

**What it does** — Applies one op. All reads and writes go through `conn` — the
connection holding the note's advisory lock — so the whole batch runs on a single
connection (cannot deadlock against the bounded pool) and the order's
read-modify-write is serialised across instances (issue #45).

First gate, all variants: **writer identity** — `op.last_writer()` must equal the
authenticated device id (`bad_writer` otherwise). Clients cannot forge edits in
someone else's name, and two devices of one user never share a vv component
(sharing one would make the server treat the second device's concurrent edits as
replays). Presence stays user-based; only the vv actor is the device.

Per variant:

- **`Insert`** — content checks (`bad_content` on `\n`, `CODE_LINE_TOO_LONG` over
  `MAX_LINE_BYTES` — UTF-8 **bytes**, exactly what the client counts);
  `line_exists` if the line id is already taken; load the order (`NotFound` without
  one); `CODE_TOO_MANY_LINES` when the note already holds `MAX_LINES_PER_NOTE`
  **live** lines (`count_live_lines_on`, a `deleted_at IS NULL` count — not
  `order.order.len()`, which includes tombstones and would refuse notes the client
  considers under the limit); `bad_after`
  if the anchor is not in the order (`None` anchor = insert at the beginning).
  Resolution **against the order entity** (design §5.2): `advances_writer` +
  `winner` — a stale insert loses against the current order and is `Ignored`.
  On win: insert the line row, then write the new order with
  `merge_vv(order.vv, op.vv)`.
- **`Update`** — content checks; the line must exist **in this note**
  (`not_found`); resolution against the **line** entity (`advances_writer` +
  `line_winner`); on win, update content with the merged vv.
- **`Delete`** — the line must exist in this note; resolution against the line;
  on win, **soft-delete**: set `deleted_at` (tombstone), merged vv. The row
  remains; tombstones ship in snapshots and are GC'd only after `LINES_GC_DAYS`.
- **`Move`** — `bad_move` on empty `line_ids` or when the anchor is itself moved;
  every moved id must be in the order (`not_found`); resolution against the
  order. On win: extract the moved block, reinsert it after the anchor
  (`bad_after` if the anchor vanished from the filtered order), write the new
  order with the merged vv.

**Dependencies** — `LineOp::last_writer` (`protocol.rs`); the `_on(executor)`
store variants `get_line_on`, `get_note_order_on`, `insert_line_on`,
`update_line_on`, `soft_delete_line_on`, `set_note_order_on` (`store.rs`);
`invalid`, `merge_vv`, `advances_writer`, `winner`, `line_winner`,
`position_after` (this file); `Store::count_live_lines_on` (expects it to count
only `deleted_at IS NULL` rows, which is what makes the server's line count mean
the same as the client's); `keeplin_core::format::{MAX_LINE_BYTES,
MAX_LINES_PER_NOTE, CODE_LINE_TOO_LONG, CODE_TOO_MANY_LINES}` — expects these to
be the very constants the client validates against, which is guaranteed by
importing them rather than redeclaring them and by pinning keeplin-core to an
exact `rev`.

**Used by** — `handle_msg` (`Op` arm) only.

**Repeated context** — The complete op pipeline, restated: writer gate →
shape/limit validation → existence → `advances_writer` (idempotency) →
`note_log::resolve` (vv dominance, then the deterministic
`(updated_at, last_writer)` LWW tiebreak) → persist with merged vv → fan out.
`Insert`/`Move` resolve against the **order** entity; `Update`/`Delete` against
the **line** — the two-entity model that makes structural edits and content edits
independently mergeable.

## fn winner

**Identification** — private function; marker `// md:fn winner`.

**Code** — complete and verbatim:

```rust
// md:fn winner
fn winner(
    order: &crate::store::NoteOrder,
    op_vv: &VersionVector,
    op_ts: DateTime<Utc>,
    op_writer: &str,
) -> Winner {
    resolve(
        &order.vv,
        order.updated_at,
        &order.last_writer,
        op_vv,
        op_ts,
        op_writer,
    )
}
```

**What it does** — Resolves an op against the **order** entity by delegating to
keeplin-core's `note_log::resolve(current_vv, current_ts, current_writer, op_vv,
op_ts, op_writer)`. `Winner::Incoming` = apply.

**Dependencies** — `resolve`/`Winner` (keeplin-core), `NoteOrder` (`store.rs`).

**Used by** — `apply_op` (`Insert`, `Move`).

**Repeated context** — Using the *same* `resolve` as every client is what
guarantees server and clients pick the same winner — the convergence contract.

## fn line_winner

**Identification** — private function; marker `// md:fn line_winner`.

**Code** — complete and verbatim:

```rust
// md:fn line_winner
fn line_winner(
    line: &Line,
    op_vv: &VersionVector,
    op_ts: DateTime<Utc>,
    op_writer: &str,
) -> Winner {
    resolve(
        &line.vv.0,
        line.updated_at,
        &line.last_writer,
        op_vv,
        op_ts,
        op_writer,
    )
}
```

**What it does** — The same resolution against a **line** entity
(`line.vv.0`, `line.updated_at`, `line.last_writer`).

**Dependencies** — `resolve`/`Winner` (keeplin-core), `Line` (`store.rs`).

**Used by** — `apply_op` (`Update`, `Delete`).

**Repeated context** — as `fn winner`.

---

## fn position_after

**Identification** — private function; marker `// md:fn position_after`.
`fn position_after(order: &[Uuid], after_line_id: Option<Uuid>) -> Option<usize>`.

**Code** — complete and verbatim:

```rust
// md:fn position_after
fn position_after(order: &[Uuid], after_line_id: Option<Uuid>) -> Option<usize> {
    match after_line_id {
        None => Some(0),
        Some(after) => order.iter().position(|id| *id == after).map(|i| i + 1),
    }
}
```

**What it does** — The index right after `after_line_id` in `order`
(`None` anchor = index 0, the beginning). Returns `None` when the anchor line is
absent — the caller maps that to `bad_after`.

**Dependencies** — none.

**Used by** — `apply_op` (`Insert`, `Move`).

**Repeated context** — Anchor-based positioning (rather than numeric indices) is
what keeps concurrent inserts meaningful after resolution reorders things.

## Graph context

Repo-tooling metadata, not a code block (no marker in the source). Kept in every
companion because CI (`scripts/check-docs.sh`) enforces it: this file is LAYER 2 of
the navigation model, the Graphify graph (`graphify-out/graph.json`) is LAYER 1;
refresh with `graphify update .` after refactors.

<!-- Data source: graphify-out/graph.json (AST pass; `graphify update .` refreshes it).
     EXTRACTED = mechanically from the graph; INFERRED = authored judgement. -->
