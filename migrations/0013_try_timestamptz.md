# `0013_try_timestamptz.sql` — safe text→timestamptz cast for the history access window

## Complete migration

```sql
-- Helper for the history access-window fix (HISTORY_VISIBILITY=access loophole).
--
-- `entity_history` now windows a collaborator's view by the *payload's own* causal
-- timestamp (`updated_at` inside the Change snapshot, `deleted_at` for tombstones)
-- instead of the journal row's `received_at` — journal re-delivery (a reinstalled
-- client re-pushing from epoch) mints fresh `received_at` values and defeated the
-- old filter, leaking pre-access versions.
--
-- Those timestamps live inside client-supplied opaque JSON, so a bare
-- `::timestamptz` cast in the query would let one malformed payload turn every
-- history read into a 500. This function is the safe cast: NULL on anything
-- unparseable (the query then falls back to `received_at`, matching how the
-- displayed version timestamp has always been derived).
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION keeplin_try_timestamptz(value text)
RETURNS timestamptz
LANGUAGE plpgsql
STABLE
PARALLEL SAFE
AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN value::timestamptz;
EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS THEN
    RETURN NULL;
END;
$$;

```

## What it does

Creates `keeplin_try_timestamptz(text) RETURNS timestamptz`: the value parsed as a
`timestamptz`, or `NULL` if the cast raises (malformed string, `NULL` input propagates as
`NULL`). `STABLE PARALLEL SAFE` plpgsql with an exception handler.

## Why

Closes the `HISTORY_VISIBILITY=access` loophole (see `../crates/keeplin-srv/src/store.md`,
`entity_history`): the collaborator access window is now compared against the **payload's own
causal timestamp** (`payload->'note'/'notebook'->>'updated_at'`, or `payload->>'deleted_at'`
for tombstones) instead of the journal row's `received_at`. Journal re-delivery — a
reinstalled client re-pushing its journal from epoch — creates fresh rows with fresh
`received_at`, which defeated the old filter and leaked pre-access versions to collaborators.

The payload is client-supplied opaque JSON. A bare `(…)::timestamptz` cast inside the history
query would make a single malformed `updated_at` (accidental or malicious) turn **every**
history read for that entity into a 500 — a denial of service on the endpoint. Wrapping the
cast in an exception-handling function degrades a malformed value to `NULL`; the query then
`COALESCE`s to `received_at`, which is exactly the fallback the displayed version timestamp
has always used for old payloads without one.

## Index note

No index change: the history query is driven by the 0009 expression indexes on the extracted
entity id (`idx_changes_note_id` / `idx_changes_notebook_id` / `idx_changes_top_id`), which
remain the selective filter. The timestamp comparison only post-filters the (small) per-entity
row set, so an expression index on `keeplin_try_timestamptz(...)` would buy nothing.

## Forward-only

Like every migration here: never edit it after it has been applied anywhere; correct with a
new migration. `CREATE OR REPLACE` makes a re-run idempotent in fresh test databases.
