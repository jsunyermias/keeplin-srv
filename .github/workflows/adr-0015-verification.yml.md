# `.github/workflows/adr-0015-verification.yml` — ADR 0015 live credential verification

## Purpose

The original implementation of the fourth test in verification item 9 of
[keeplin ADR 0015](https://github.com/jsunyermias/keeplin/blob/main/docs/adr/0015-self-authorized-disposal-with-an-auditable-directive.md) is the test
named `evaluator_GITHUB_TOKEN_really_enumerates_the_expected_repository_principals` in
`.github/scripts/check-review-loop.test.js`. On each CI execution, that test uses the run's actual
`GITHUB_TOKEN`, exercises the worktree copy of the enumerator, compares the result with the
literal `["jsunyermias"]`, and reports failure through the required
`Check, Test & Lint` job. It skips locally when CI or the token is absent. The test derives
`owner` and `repo` from `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`, so here it queries `jsunyermias/keeplin-srv`. Its
expected set is the literal `["jsunyermias"]`, embedded in a file shared byte-for-byte between
both repositories; it matches here only because both currently have the same individual owner,
not because the expected set is derived.

This workflow adds a probe that runs on pushes to `main`, on a daily schedule even when repository
activity does not start CI (within the roughly 60-day inactivity window before GitHub disables the
schedule), and by manual dispatch. It derives the expected singleton from
`repository.owner.login`, exercises evaluator code fetched from the API-reported default branch,
and reports failure through its own job outside the required-job set. It measures whether the
evaluator's actual `GITHUB_TOKEN` can exhaustively enumerate the repository principals and whether
the single-principal premise for Option C holds. The first run on `keeplin-srv`'s `main` is the
first measurement of that premise for this repository: a failure caused by a second principal is
a repository-state result, not a workflow defect.

The daily run is scheduled for 06:17 UTC. Its off-hour minute avoids concentrating the request at
the start of an hour, when GitHub warns that scheduled runs can be delayed. The push trigger makes
the merge that introduces this workflow exercise its final assertion and makes later failures
visible on the affected default-branch commit. Scheduled workflows are best-effort and GitHub
automatically disables them after 60 days without repository activity. The schedule is an early
warning only: the evaluator independently enumerates principals on every authorization path and
refuses the affected disposition when enumeration is unknown or the single-principal premise is
false.

## Execution contract

The workflow grants exactly the five permissions granted to
[`review-loop-evaluator.yml`](review-loop-evaluator.yml). It fetches
`.github/scripts/check-review-loop.js` from the API-reported default branch with
`repos.getContent`, evaluates it with `vm.runInNewContext`, and calls the exported
`enumerateRepositoryPrincipals`. It therefore exercises the same implementation and credential
used by authorization rather than a local checkout or a parallel pagination loop.

Success requires `ok === true` and `principals` to equal exactly the lower-cased repository owner
login as a singleton array. A forbidden, rate-limited, malformed, failed, or non-exhaustive
enumeration fails the job. A second principal also fails the job and becomes observable in the
step summary and error, while the workflow remains outside the required-job set and does not
block unrelated repository changes. It has neither a `pull_request` nor a
`pull_request_target` trigger, so it does not run as a pull-request check.

## Trust boundary

There is no checkout and no shell step. The action is pinned to a full commit SHA, and evaluator
code comes from the default branch. The expected login comes from the repository payload rather
than a literal, but the singleton `[owner.login]` expectation deliberately
assumes a personally-owned repository. As ADR 0015's Decision records, moving either repository
to an organization requires revisiting this guard before relying on it. The job name is
deliberately distinct from the required CI jobs `Check, Test & Lint` and
`Knowledge graph up to date`.
