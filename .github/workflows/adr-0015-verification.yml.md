# `.github/workflows/adr-0015-verification.yml` — ADR 0015 live credential verification

## Purpose

This workflow implements the fourth test in verification item 9 of
[keeplin ADR 0015](https://github.com/jsunyermias/keeplin/blob/main/docs/adr/0015-self-authorized-disposal-with-an-auditable-directive.md).
It measures whether the evaluator's actual `GITHUB_TOKEN` can exhaustively enumerate this
repository's principals and whether the single-principal premise for Option C holds here. The
first run on `keeplin-srv`'s `main` is the first measurement of that premise for this repository:
a failure caused by a second principal is a repository-state result, not a workflow defect.

It runs on every push to `main`, is scheduled to run daily at 06:17 UTC, and supports manual
dispatch. The push trigger makes the merge that introduces this workflow exercise its final
assertion and makes later failures visible on the affected default-branch commit. The off-hour
minute avoids concentrating the scheduled request at the start of an hour, when GitHub warns that
scheduled runs can be delayed. Scheduled workflows are best-effort and GitHub automatically
disables them after 60 days without repository activity. The schedule is an early warning only:
the evaluator independently enumerates principals on every authorization path and refuses the
affected disposition when enumeration is unknown or the single-principal premise is false.

## Execution contract

The workflow grants exactly the five permissions granted to
[`review-loop-evaluator.yml`](review-loop-evaluator.yml). It fetches
`.github/scripts/check-review-loop.js` from the API-reported default branch with
`repos.getContent`, evaluates it with `vm.runInNewContext`, and calls the exported
`enumerateRepositoryPrincipals`. It therefore exercises the same implementation and credential
used by authorization rather than a local checkout or a parallel pagination loop.

Success requires `ok === true` and `principals` to equal exactly the lower-cased repository owner
login as a singleton array. A forbidden, rate-limited, malformed, failed, or non-exhaustive
enumeration fails the job. A second principal also fails the job and becomes observable in the
step summary and error, while the workflow remains outside the required-job set and does not
block unrelated repository changes. It has neither a `pull_request` nor a
`pull_request_target` trigger, so it does not run as a pull-request check.

## Trust boundary

There is no checkout and no shell step. The action is pinned to a full commit SHA, and evaluator
code comes from the default branch. The expected login comes from the repository payload rather
than a repository-specific literal, but the singleton `[owner.login]` expectation deliberately
assumes a personally-owned repository. As ADR 0015's Decision records, moving either repository
to an organization requires revisiting this guard before relying on it. The job name is
deliberately distinct from the required CI jobs `Check, Test & Lint` and
`Knowledge graph up to date`.
